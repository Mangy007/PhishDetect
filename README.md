# Phishing-Attack-Detection

This paper proposes a lightweight **Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM)** based phishing URL detection framework for mitigating the threats posed by phishing attacks. The proposed framework initially splits the URLs into four distinct components namely, *Protocol type, do- main, sub-domain and top level domain(TLD)* using a set of special characters as delimiters. Different feature values corresponding to these four components are then used to build a vocabulary database of the URL corpus. Thereafter, a customized FastText word embedding technique is used to learn numeric feature vector representations of the tokens(URL features) present in the vocabulary database. These learned feature vectors, along with the pre-processed instances of the URL corpus are then provided as input to train a BiLSTM based classifier model for detection of malicious phishing URLs. Experimental results on a proprietary URL corpus comprising 200,000 normal and phishing URL instances show that the proposed framework achieves high accuracy in detecting malicious phishing URLs with minimal computational overhead.
